patterns = {

"I'm wondering if…": """
I'm wondering if that comfortable feeling in your feet 
will spread up into the rest of your body.
I'm wondering if you can pretend that you never smoked in your life and 
imagine what it is like to go through a typical day.
I didn't tell you to do anything, I was just wondering...""",

Maybe you'll dream of new ways to say things tonight.
Maybe you'll spot the hidden commands in sentences.""",

        "You probably already know…": """
You probably already know how useful indirect communication really is.""",

        "Don't _____ too quickly.": """
This phrase implies that what I suggest will definitely happen,
and all that matters is *when* it happens.
And if you resist you might internally 
say, 'Oh yeah, who says I cant do it quickly!? I'll show you!'
Don't release all the tension in your body too quickly,
just relax and listen to the sounds around you.""",

        "Can you imagine…": """
People are more likely to do what is familiar, 
and imagining things is a great way to create familiarity.

Can you imagine all the situations where you would use 
this language pattern if you fully learn it?.""",

        "One can, <name>, _____": """
By adding the person's name, you make the command 
much more powerful.

One can, Eve, feel good for no reason at all.
One can, Sara, enjoy the experience of hypnosis without 
knowing exactly what is going to happen.

Who can? ... One can. We're not talking about you, Joe.""",

        "You might notice the feelings ... as you…": """
'You might notice the feelings' directs the attention to 
the inner body sensations, which is good for hypnotic inductions.
'As you' provides another opportunity for an indirect suggestion.

You might notice the feelings in your feet as 
you relax them completely.""",

        "A person might, <name>, _____.": """
Say the name close to the second half of the sentence, and it 
becomes a personal embedded command.

A person might, <name>, find a great reason to finally 
make that change in your life.""",

        "One could _____, because…": """
'Because' is the magic word, because it lends 
credibility to whatever goes before it.""",

        "You can _____ because…": """
Here's the 'because' again.
You can just use it and discover how powerful it is, 
because you can pretty much say anything you want after it. 
You can even use it in everyday conversations, because people love to hear reasons for things.""",

        "You can _____, can you not?": """
'Can you not' is such a great way to end a statement. 
It turns it into a question which is less threatening, and 
it's so confusing to try and disagree with. 
You can relax into that chair, can you not?
You can allow new solution to come to you, can you not?.""",

        "I don't know if _____.": """
I don't know if you're going to like this game better 
than any other learning game you've ever played. I don't know which parts in particular you are 
going to enjoy the most.
I really don't know if this experience is going to change 
your life. Don't ask me, I don't know.""",

        "You might notice how good… feels, when you…": """
The hidden assumption is that what I'm suggesting feels good, 
and the 'when you' part further assumes that you're going to do it.

You might notice how good your eyes feel when they close and remain closed.
You might notice how good your arms feel when you relax them as they rest on the chair.""",

        "Will you …, or …, or …": """
This is the form of infinite choice, and I'll cover all the 
possibilities so you can't help but do what i say.
And if you get into the habit of doing what I say, sometime I 
may begin to actually lead you.
Will your hand begin to lift up automatically, 
or will it relax just where it is, or will you notice 
certain sensations in your hand that you can enjoy.""",

        "I woudn't tell you to _____, because…": """
I wouldn't tell you (here I am telling you anyway), and you can't 
disagree, because I said that I wouldn't tell you.
And I use the magic word 'because' to make another
comment, *because* it lends authority to what i just said 
and it carries attention away from the embedded command before 
you consciously recognize it.""",

        "How would it feel if you…?": """
In order to answer this question you have to imagine what I propose.

How would it feel if you felt at peace in that unpleasant situation?""",

        "I could tell you that but…": """
I could tell you that ... , but I won't, so you have no reason to resist 
or take offense at what I just didn't tell you. 
I could tell you that this experience will give you more 
confidence and self-assurance, but I would rather let you 
discover that for yourself.""",

Sometimes you might indirectly get a person to imagine a situation where they have the resources you want them to feel.""",

        "Eventually…": """
Eventually everything comes to pass.

Eventually you will develop a deep understanding of these difficult 
events in your life, and you will find some hidden value in them. 
Eventually, indirect language patterns will become second nature to you. Imagine that.""",

        "Try to resist…": """
'Try to resist' implies that you will try, but you won't be able to do it.
You can use your voice inflection to emphasize the implication.

Try to resist a deepening sense of relaxation as you breathe.
Try to resist the sensation that your hands are becoming so relaxed that they just won't move.""",

        "You might not have noticed…": """
